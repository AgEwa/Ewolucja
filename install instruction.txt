This is the instruction on how to run the application.

First of all install python on your OS, as this is the programming language we used for ths application.
The most recent versions of python and pip are required (python-3.13 and pip-24.3.1).

In this guide we'll use command prompt (cmd), so pay attention to kind of slashes used ('\' on Windows and '/' on Linux).
Clone (or download and extract zip) from https://github.com/AgEwa/Ewolucja.
Let's assume you placed the project under 'project_name' directory:
git clone https://github.com/AgEwa/Ewolucja project_name

Move inside project directory:
cd project_name

Here we will install python virtual environment, so not to globally install packages:
python -m venv .venv

After we activate venv:
.venv\Scripts\activate

Now you should see '(.venv)' at the start of command line. This means you are in activate virtual environment.
Let's install needed python dependencies with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

The last step is to actually run the application. Use the next:
python src\gui\app.py
It will launch a window application.

After application is finished (main window closed AND all simulation processes ended) you'll see so in command line.

In order to exit venv use:
deactivate
